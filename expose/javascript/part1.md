**Question 1**: Line 9 prints `values added: 20` because `result` is in the function scope.

**Question 2**: Line 13 prints `final result: 20` because `result` is in the function scope, which allows it to be accessed outside of the `if` statement.

**Question 3**: Line 9 prints `values added: 20` because `result` is in the block scope of the log statement.

**Question 4**: The code errors out on line 13 because the log statement is not in the block scope of the `if` statement, which means `result` is not defined.

**Question 5**: The code errors out on line 7 because `result` is a constant, and cannot be reassigned to a new value after initialization, so the log statement never prints.

**Question 6**: The code errors out on line 7 for the reasons described in **Q5**, but even if the code worked correctly on line 7, the code would error out on line 13 because the log statement is not in the block scope of the `if` statement, which means `result` is not defined.
